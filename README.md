# Used EV Purchase Modeling

This project models and analyzes the factors influencing second-hand electric vehicle (EV) sales using a simulated dataset from the IntelliDrive Automotive Research Institute (IARI).

## 📁 Contents

- `R/R Code - MNL & Tobit.R`: Main R script for data prep, modeling, and visualization.
- `data/cm_car_sales_data_2425.csv`: Simulated dataset of 10,000 used EV transactions.
- `report/IARI EV Report.pdf`: Full analysis report.

## 🔧 Methods Used

- Logistic Regression (binary outcomes)
- Multinomial Logit (brand choice modeling)
- Tobit Regression (censored trade-in values)
- Performance metrics: AIC, Lift Curve, Hit Rate, LR test

## 📊 Dataset Source

The dataset is simulated by the IntelliDrive Automotive Research Institute (IARI) for academic research. It covers used EV transactions across five U.S. states.
